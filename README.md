This is a work-in-progress version. I'll still need to improve the logic and styling and add some additional functionality.

In this version of the game, there are 4 virtual users, and the player is always the judge. The game has 20 rounds, during which the player opens a black card and then reveals white cards from each user (without knowing to whom each white card belongs). The judge chooses the funniest answer, and the winner gets a score point. After 20 rounds, an alert will appear with the name of the winner.

Official game rules can be found here: [Game Rules](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/vc07edlh/production/ddf02ce6c4a0bbebdb737abdf86c00e2795ee1b2.pdf)

**Planned improvements:**

- Adapt for mobile;
- Improve styles (add animations);
- Create a second version of the game where the player is not the judge and has 10 cards to choose the funniest;
- Create a Node.js backend and request data from there;
- And more.
